Look for the task1 notebook attached and download the dataset. Arrange the folders in the following way for better training and testing required further.

/Dataset
	/train
		/anthracnose_cashew
		/gumosis_cashew
		/healthy_cashew
		…
		/verticulium wilt_tomato
		
	/test
    		/anthracnose_cashew
		/gumosis_cashew
		/healthy_cashew
		…
		/verticulium wilt_tomato

The files must be named in the given way as well as arranged in the exact same way mentioned. 
Also you are required to generate one image of each of 22 classes.

Download of the dataset is going to take some time so make sure to be patient :)
