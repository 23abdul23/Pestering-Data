# Pestering-Data
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture has become increasingly prominent in recent years. AI in agriculture primarily aims to enhance crop productivity, manage pests and diseases, and reduce operational costs. In many developing countries, the agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including crop diseases and pest infestations, limited access to technological knowledge among farmers, and inadequate storage infrastructure, among other issues.

Since, we have a large dataset, it will be fun to work with it having 22 classes divided into four categories Cashew, Cassava, Maize, and Tomato. Further each folder has two folders test_set and train_set. And further into more classes specifying diseasesd classes and healthy one.

**Problem Statement: Using new age technologies of deep learning to deal with such a large dataset, participants are required to create a model to classify images based on the disease or healthy.**
