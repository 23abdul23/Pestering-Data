# **🌿 Welcome to Pestering-Data**  
**Using Deep Learning to Classify Crop Health and Diseases**  

---

## 🚀 **Overview**  
The use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in agriculture has become increasingly prominent in recent years. AI in agriculture primarily aims to **enhance crop productivity**, **manage pests and diseases**, and **reduce operational costs**. In many developing countries, the agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including **crop diseases and pest infestations**, **limited access to technological knowledge** among farmers, and **inadequate storage infrastructure**, among other issues.  

This project introduces a **large-scale dataset** comprising **22 classes** divided into **4 main crops**:  
- 🌰 **Cashew**  
- 🥔 **Cassava**  
- 🌽 **Maize**  
- 🍅 **Tomato**  

Each category has further subdivisions:  
- **Healthy classes**  
- **Disease-specific classes**  

### 🎯 **Goal**  
Leverage modern **Deep Learning** techniques to create a model that accurately classifies crop images as either **diseased** or **healthy**.  

📂 **Dataset Structure:**  
Each crop folder contains:  
- **train_set/** for training  
- **test_set/** for testing  

🔗 **Dataset Link:** [**Kaggle Dataset**](https://kaggle.com/datasets/70386cefea61cfef7efab20c1a430a79a734ef495661efc02b2630b98d8cafc7)
